Find All Duplicates
Write a function (or a static method in the case of Java) that accepts a list of integers and returns a list
of only those integers that appear more than once.

Describe Different Approaches to Solving This Problem
A nested loop is inefficient in terms of order and therefore scales poorly with frequent calls.
A positive of the nested loop approach is that it is able to collect information on duplicates such as
index, number of duplicates, etc.

A dictionary or map (don't you mean set? doesn't matter they're all generally unique) can
quickly identify a list has duplicates but doesn't return information on the duplicates. I'm sure
a much smarter person than me could figure it out though, I mean surely. Then again we're working with
integers here, not objects.

I assume you want me to write it here:
Our branch is "aHEAD" of the main branch in terms of commits. This is a branch with changes to the most recent main.
